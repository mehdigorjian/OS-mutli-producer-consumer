```
COMPILATION: gcc fileName.c -o fileName -pthread
        RUN: ./fileName (1)producer_number (2)consumer_number (3)QueueSize (4)Max_Loop_Size_inside_producer_consumer
* RUNNING EXAMPLE: ./gorjianm_proj1.exe 5 5 5 5
* the code should be compiled with the -pthread flag
* the code should be run with 4 arguments:
                (1) number of producers
